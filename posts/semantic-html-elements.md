## What Are Semantic HTML Elements?

<br>

Semantic HTMl elements are elements that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. Some examples include: `<form>`, `<table>` and `<nav>`.

<br>

## Replacing Divs

<br>

When building front end websites with HTMl, you will often find yourself using divs with classes like nav, header and footer to indiciate navigations, headers and footers. However in HTML5, you can use semantic elements that define different parts of the web page. The following is a list of the most commonly used semantic elements in HTML that you can start using:

<br>

- `<article>`
- `<section>`
- `<nav>`
- `<footer>`
- `<main>`
- `<header>`

<br>

### The `<article>` Element

<br>

The `<article>` element specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should be completely understandable on its own even if the rest of the content present on the website was not there. An `<article>` element could be used for a variety of content including blog posts, newspaper articles and forum posts. For example, the following code could be used to display an article.

<br>

```html
 <article>Independent content that should be readable on its own</article>
```

<br>

### The `<section>` Element

<br>

.

<br>

```html

```

<br>

### The `<nav>` Element

<br>

.

<br>

```html

```

<br>

### The `<footer>` Element

<br>

.

<br>

```html

```

<br>

### The `<main>` Element

<br>

.

<br>

```html

```

<br>

### The `<header>` Element

<br>

.

<br>

```html

```
