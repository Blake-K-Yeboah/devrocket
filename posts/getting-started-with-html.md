## What is HTML?

<br>

HTML, Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language designed to display content on websites. It is the basic building block of every website that exists today. Despite what framework or server-side language used, the content of the user interface of a website boils down to HTML.

<br>

## Text Editors

<br>

While HTML can be written in a program as basic as notepad, I recommend using a full-fledged text editor. Proper text editors provide code highlighting as well as auto-complete that will significantly increase your efficiency in writing HTML and code in general. Some popular text editors include:

<br>

- **Visual Studio Code**
- Sublime Text
- Atom
- Notepad++
  
<br>

Visual Studio Code is bolded as its the one I would recommend.

It fully up to you what text editor you want to use. Whether its Visual Studio Code or Notepad, make sure you're happy with it as you will be using it a lot.

<br>

## Browser

<br>

Obviously, you will need a web browser. In fact, you're probably using a web browser to view this article now. Computers with Windows installed, automatically come Microsoft Edge however, I would recommend using Google Chrome. Google Chrome, a web browser made by Google, is a great browser that is fast and has great developer tools. Some other popular browsers include:

<br>

- Firefox
- Safari (For Mac)
- Opera
- Brave

<br>

As long as your not using internet explorer, you will likely be fine and not run into any problems. Just make sure you are happy with your browser.

<br>

## Setting Up File Structure

<br>

Create a new folder on your desktop or wherever you want to store your website files; call it _first-website_ or anything you want. Inside of that folder, create a file called _index.html_ and open it in your desired text editor.

<br>

<blockquote>Tip: You may need to make file extensions visible in your operating system to make sure its a '.html' file.</blockquote>
