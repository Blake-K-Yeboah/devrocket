## Overview

<br>

This article will talk about customizing Visual Studio Code including installing extensions and changing your color theme.

<br>

## Changing Color Theme

<br>

Changing your color theme is very simple in Visual Studio Code. 

<br>

1. Hit 'CTRL' + 'SHIFT' + 'P'
   
2. You should then see whats called the command palette. It looks like this:
   
<br>

<br><br>

<blockquote>
 Note: your options may look slightly different (mainly at top: recently used) howver the process remains the same.
</blockquote>

<br>

3. Search for Color Theme, click on "Preferences: Color Theme" and you will then be taken to a menu where you can select one.

<br>

<blockquote>
 Tip: You will have minimal color themes available right off the bat. You can install more through the Extensions tab (Hit CTRL+SHIFT+X).
</blockquote>

<br>

I currently use a theme called Aurora X and I find it clean, nice and great to use. Some popular options include:

<br>

**Dracula**

## Installing Extensions

<br>

Installing extensions will significantly boost your productivity as a developer and allow you to do code much easier. So how do you install an extension?

<br>

1. First, open the extensions tag by clicking on the extensions icon in the sidebar. This will open up a tab that looks like this:

<br>

<br><br>

2. You can then click on the search bar in the top left of the screen and search for an extension. This will then bring up the extension's page.  For example, the CSS Peek extension page looks like this:

<br>

<br><br>

<blockquote>
    Note: On my screenshot it shows uninstall since I already have the extension however yours will just say 'Install'.
</blockquote>

<br>

3. Finally, click the install button and the extension will be installed.
