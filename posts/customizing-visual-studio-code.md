## Overview

<br>

This article will talk about customizing Visual Studio Code including installing extensions and changing your color theme.

<br>

## Changing Color Theme

<br>

Changing your color theme is very simple in Visual Studio Code. 

<br>

1. Hit 'CTRL' + 'SHIFT' + 'P'
   
2. You should then see whats called the command palette. It looks like this:

<blockquote>
 Note: your options may look slightly different (mainly at top: recently used) howver the process remains the same.
</blockquote>

<br>

3. Search for Color Theme, click on "Preferences: Color Theme" and you will then be taken to a menu where you can select one.

<br>

<blockquote>
 Tip: You will have minimal color themes available right off the bat. You can install more through the Extensions tab (Hit CTRL+SHIFT+X).
</blockquote>

<br>

I currently use a theme called Aurora X and I find it clean, nice and great to use. Some popular options include:

<br>

**Dracula**
